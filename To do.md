[x] Please make plots for phosphatase looking in the same way as for Prabakaran model. No need to present matrices on picture, but the overall look should be the same
    [?] Find the original parameter values?
[x] Please prepare 2 matrices for plot on Figure 4C, one with detected feedback and one without. We will use both plots and matrices.
[x] SI. Things that are strictly necessary:
    [x] equations and some explanatory plots on RAF-MST2 model
        * Remark: No nice parameters, not in linear range, rather in saturation.
[x] All the examples that do not have matrices will not go into SI. Here it's up to you, what you want to be presented and what not. To me it's OK with what we have now, but you did much more, so it's up to you to decide.
        * Remark: I think the principle is clear, no need to spam the SI full with examples
